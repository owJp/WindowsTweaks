READ BEFORE TRYING THE TWEAKS:
1. Please be aware that I am not responsible for any damage that may occur to your PC if you are going to apply these tweaks.
2. I recommend saving a backup like a system restore point or clone your operating system to easily revert back if something breaks on your PC.
3. This is a work in progress, and some of the information could be wrong, but I try to do plenty of research and testing before putting it here. If you also see information that you feel like is wrong, please point it out.
