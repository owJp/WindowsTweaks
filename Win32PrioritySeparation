Win32PrioritySeparation is a setting within the Windows Registry that allows users to configure how the operating system's scheduler allocates processor resources to foreground and background processes.

Registry Path: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\PriorityControl\Win32PrioritySeparation]

Values:
2A Hex = Short, Fixed , High foreground boost.
29 Hex = Short, Fixed , Medium foreground boost.
28 Hex = Short, Fixed , No foreground boost.

26 Hex = Short, Variable , High foreground boost.
25 Hex = Short, Variable , Medium foreground boost.
24 Hex = Short, Variable , No foreground boost.

1A Hex = Long, Fixed, High foreground boost.
19 Hex = Long, Fixed, Medium foreground boost.
18 Hex = Long, Fixed, No foreground boost.

16 Hex = Long, Variable, High foreground boost.
15 Hex = Long, Variable, Medium foreground boost.
14 Hex = Long, Variable, No foreground boost.

-------------------------------------------------
Short and Long Quantum is the allocated time of how long a process will run on the CPU before it switches to another process or CPU time.

Short: Offers lower latency, and more responsivenese for processes. Higher interupts and faster process switching
Long: Offers the best for fps and smoothness but can make the foreground and background process feel less responsive. Lower interupts and slower process switching.
(Foreground is the process that is running and is currently displayed on your screen and background are the process that is running but isnt currently displayed on your screen for example: Discord open on the background)

Fixed and Variable Quantum
Fixed: Quantum value is stable and is consistent
Variable: Quantum value adapts to changes and increases

Note: The Information here is not final and might change since I am currently doing more research and tryna dig into the microsoft files for more information.
-------------------------------------------------

2A Hex Value provides the the highest fps and cpu performance at the expense of some latency.
28 Hex Value provides the lowest latency and highest responsiveness at the expense of some fps.
26 Hex Value provides the best balance of both.
